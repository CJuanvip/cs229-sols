# CS229 Machine Learning
My ```python``` solutions to the problem sets in Andrew Ng's [http://cs229.stanford.edu/](CS229 course) for Fall 2016.

**Note:** The solutions to the theoretical portions of the problem sets in the homeworks directory are the official problem solutions, not my own. I do not provide my own solutions in this repository. This repo is for the programming parts only.
